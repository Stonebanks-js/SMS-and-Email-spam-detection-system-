# **SMS and Email Spam Detection System**
This project is a machine learning-based application designed to classify messages and emails as either spam or ham (not spam).

## Features

- Spam Classification: Predicts whether a given SMS or email message is spam or not.
- Machine Learning Model: Utilizes a trained model for accurate predictions.
- Web Interface: Provides a user-friendly interface for inputting messages and viewing results.

## Installation

1 : Clone the Repository:
 < git clone https://github.com/Stonebanks-js/SMS-and-Email-spam-detection-system-.git >

2 : Navigate to the Project Directory: 
 < cd SMS-and-Email-spam-detection-system- >

3 : Create a Virtual Environment:
 < python -m venv venv >

4 : On Windows:
 < venv\Scripts\activate > 

 : On linux : 
 < source venv/bin/activate >

5 : Install Dependencies: 
 < pip install -r requirements.txt >

## Usage

1 : Run the Application: 
 < python app.py >

2 : Access the web interface :
 < Open your web browser and navigate to http://127.0.0.1:5000/. >

3 : Classify a Message: :
- Enter the text of the SMS or email message into the input field.
- Click the "Predict" button to determine if the message is spam or ham.

## Dataset

The model is trained on a dataset containing labeled SMS messages. The dataset is included in the repository as spam.csv.

## Model Training

The model was trained using a Jupyter Notebook (SMS_SPAM_CLASSIFIER.ipynb) included in the repository. It utilizes a machine learning algorithm to achieve accurate spam detection.

## Dependencies

- Python 3.x
- Flask
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook

All required Python packages are listed in requirements.txt.
